#Loading Scene with Scene Manager

In Unity 5, *SceneManager* support `LoadSceneMode` to load another scene to current scene. This helps you to split out a huge scene into independent scens. 

Yet another usage is to make a loading animation alone with `LoadSceneAsync` to provide smooth game level loading experience.
